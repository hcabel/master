# `std::format` placeholder highlighter

It's a small extension that highlights the `std::format` placeholder strings.<br/>
In all your cpp literal strings your `{}` will be highlighted.

##### *This extension required better cpp syntax too work*


### /!\ Might not work when downloading from the marketplace /!\
So Yeah, I don't know why but when I download the extension from the marketplace it doesn't work.<br/>
But if you download the sources and install the extension locally it works fine.<br/>
I don't know I'm not an expert in vscode extension development.<br/>
if you have any idea why it doesn't work when downloaded from the marketplace **please tell me**.
